🌞 Real-Time Monitoring of Solar Power Output Using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)

📘 Project Overview

This project presents an AI-driven IoT system for real-time monitoring and prediction of solar power output.
It integrates ESP32-based sensors (voltage, current, temperature) with Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN/LSTM) implemented in Python (TensorFlow) to forecast short-term solar energy generation.

The system displays both live sensor readings and predicted power on a web interface (Flask/Firebase) and stores data locally on an SD card or in Google Sheets for future analysis.
